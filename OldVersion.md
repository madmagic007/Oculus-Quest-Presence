## Old version found
---
### If this window opened that means that you still have the old version installled. Follow the steps and read more below.  
For v2.2 i added an auto updating feature. Because this caused issues when it was installed in program files (x86) folder, it is now installed in the appdata folder.  
So please delete the folder where the old v2.1.1 is installed, by default this is "C:\Program files (x86)\Oculus Quest Discord RPC".
